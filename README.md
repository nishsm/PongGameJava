# PongGameJava
Ping Pong Java program implmented with AWT and swing 

As we all know, a pong game consists of two pads on both sides and a ball, and the player has to make sure that he hits the ball with the pad without 
missing it to win the game and score more. This Pong Game Java Project introduces some additional features that take the difficulty to the next level 
by increasing the speed of the ball as the game progresses and points are scored by both teams. There is a counter that is placed on top which gives 
live updates of the score.

To run this program and play the game download all 6 files in repository and run the file game.java which contains the main() function.
